React-based review slider that allows users to view customer reviews and testimonials through a dynamic slider interface.

The slider is controlled through React hooks like useState and useEffect, which enable the management of state and the fetching of data from an external data source.

The use of conditional rendering and the key prop on job items ensures efficient rendering of items in the list, while the integration of external icon libraries adds visual appeal to the slider interface.
